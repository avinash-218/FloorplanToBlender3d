read calibration - read calibration image & calculate wall width average
	calculate wall width average
		- grayscale
		- filter walls from grayscale
		- thresholding
		- opening (erosion + dilation)
		- bg = dilate
		- distance transform
		- fg = threshold
		- wall_filter = bg - fg
		
		- find contours on wall_filter
		- approximate contours
